//! # Basic Unversioned Data Structures
//!
//! This module provides fundamental, unversioned data structures that serve as
//! the building blocks for more complex, versioned structures in the VSDB framework.
//! These structures are designed for direct, high-performance access to the
//! underlying key-value store without versioning overhead.
//!

/// A module for the raw, unversioned map implementation.
