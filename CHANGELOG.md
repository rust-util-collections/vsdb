# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [v9.1.0] - 2026-03-09

### Changed

- **Merged `vsdb_trie_db` and `vsdb_slot_db` into `vsdb`** — they are now modules (`trie` and `slotdex`) instead of separate crates. The workspace is reduced to two crates: `vsdb_core` and `vsdb`.
- **Renamed `trie_db` -> `trie`**, inner `trie/trie` -> `trie/mpt`, `slot_db` -> `slotdex`.
- **Moved `VerMapWithProof`** from `versioned::proof` to `trie::proof`, alongside `MptCalc` and `SmtCalc`.
- **Removed `merkle` feature gate** — the `trie` module (including `sha3` and `thiserror`) is always compiled.
- All public types re-exported from crate root: `MptCalc`, `SmtCalc`, `SmtProof`, `VerMapWithProof`, `SlotDex`.

### Added

- **`SmtCalc`** — Sparse Merkle Tree with 256-level proofs (`prove` / `verify_proof`).
- **SMT cache** — `save_cache` / `load_cache` for `SmtCalc` (disposable on-disk persistence).
- Comprehensive SMT test suite (24 tests) and benchmarks.
- Architecture diagram in `trie` module docs.

## [v9.0.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- **`VerMap` convenience APIs**: `branch_id`, `branch_name`, `has_uncommitted`, `range`, `iter_at_commit`, `get_commit` — small, high-value methods for common caller patterns.
- **Versioned benchmarks**: Criterion benchmarks covering single-branch CRUD, commit/rollback, branching, iteration/range, historical reads, three-way merge, and GC.
- **Comprehensive test coverage**: 65 new tests for the new APIs; 136 total versioned tests.

### Fixed

- Fixed all Clippy warnings for Rust 1.93+ (collapsible `if`-let chains, `ptr_arg`, `needless_borrows_for_generic_args`, `type_complexity`).

## [v8.3.0] - 2024-07-27

### Changed

- **License changed from GPL-3.0 to MIT.** The entire project is now licensed under the MIT license, allowing for more permissive use and integration.
