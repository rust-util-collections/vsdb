## Won't Fix

### [MEDIUM] dagmap: serde decomposition can expose the private parent slot
- **Where**: `strata/src/dagmap/raw/mod.rs:70-127`, `strata/src/basic/orphan/mod.rs:199-224`
- **What**: callers can deserialize `DagMapRaw`'s public tuple representation into its public component types, retain an alias to the private parent `Orphan`, and later create a parent cycle through safe APIs.
- **Reason**: preventing deliberate representation decomposition requires a breaking redesign that no longer serializes recoverable component handles. Current cycle guards bound the result to failed lookups/prune errors rather than hangs or memory unsafety; keep this debt visible until a broader DagMap format redesign is justified.

---

### [LOW] engine: 16 GiB write-buffer threshold is a sizing cliff
- **Where**: `core/src/common/engine/mmdb.rs` (`mmdb_open`, `legacy_wr`)
- **What**: `legacy_wr` switches from `budget/4/NUM_SHARDS` to a fixed `1G/NUM_SHARDS` floor at the 16 GiB budget boundary.
- **Reason**: This is a pre-existing tuning discontinuity, not a correctness issue; the low side is conservative. Smoothing it changes sizing for every unconstrained host and requires a dedicated tuning campaign.

---

### [LOW] engine: budget decisions are not logged at startup
- **Where**: `core/src/common/engine/mmdb.rs` (`MEM_BUDGET`)
- **What**: Operators cannot see which constraint bound the budget or the resulting per-shard sizes.
- **Reason**: `vsdb_core` has no logging facade and is a library; unconditional stderr output from a storage engine is worse than silence. Revisit if a workspace-wide logging facade is adopted.

---

## Rejected

### vecdex: "renaming a `VecDexDyn` variant breaks persisted metas"
- **Where**: `strata/src/vecdex/dynamic.rs`
- **Claim**: Postcard persists enum variant names, so renaming `L2` would invalidate saved metadata.
- **Reason**: Postcard is non-self-describing and index/tag based; variant names are not written. `VecDexDyn` now uses explicit frozen wire tags, so source renames do not change the mapping.

---

### namespace: "`close(self)` drops the handle inside the table-lock scope unnecessarily"
- **Where**: `core/src/common/namespace.rs` (`ns_close_impl`)
- **Claim**: The consumed handle should be dropped after releasing `OPEN_NAMESPACES`.
- **Reason**: That drop is the exclusivity-accounting decrement that makes the removed entry the sole strong reference. The slow engine teardown already runs after the table lock is released; `REGISTRY_LOCK` intentionally preserves same-id lifecycle exclusion through teardown.

---

### vecdex: "`dispatch!` bindings can shadow same-named caller variables"
- **Where**: `strata/src/vecdex/dynamic.rs` (`dispatch!`)
- **Claim**: A caller binding could silently replace a query/key argument with the inner `VecDex`.
- **Reason**: The proposed misuse does not type-check; the caller explicitly chooses the binding identifier, with ordinary closure-parameter shadowing semantics. No API parameter has the inner handle type.

---

### engine: "`OnceLock::get_or_init` can run `alloc_prefix` twice under concurrent reads"
- **Where**: `core/src/common/engine/mod.rs` (`Mapx::prefix_bytes`)
- **Claim**: Concurrent readers can run both initializer closures and leak a prefix.
- **Reason**: `OnceLock::get_or_init` executes one initializer; competing callers wait for it. Double allocation cannot occur.

---

### namespace: "`DEFAULT_NS_ID` guards should be one shared helper"
- **Where**: `core/src/common/namespace.rs` (`open`, destroy, relocate, close)
- **Claim**: Similar default-namespace guards are harmful duplication.
- **Reason**: The operations intentionally diverge: open succeeds via `default_ns`, while destroy/relocate/close return distinct actionable errors. A helper would require flags/closures and reduce clarity.

---

### engine: "derated cgroup comparison undercuts host when cgroup is not binding"
- **Where**: `core/src/common/engine/mmdb.rs` (`effective_mem_budget`)
- **Claim**: Derating should occur only when the raw cgroup limit is below host memory.
- **Reason**: That change can leave `budget_limited` unset and let unconstrained write-buffer sizing cross the cgroup limit. The current min-fold is deliberately conservative and covered by semantic tests.

---

### engine: "derating should apply to `memory.high`, not `memory.max`"
- **Where**: `core/src/common/engine/mmdb.rs` (`cgroup_mem_limit_bytes`)
- **Claim**: A hard cgroup maximum is safe to budget at 100%.
- **Reason**: `memory.max` is the OOM-kill boundary and still induces reclaim/stall near the limit. Headroom below a kill line is at least as necessary as below a throttle line.
